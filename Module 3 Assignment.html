                <span style="color: darkgreen">I admire Emma Watson not only for her talent as an actress, but also for her work as
                as a humanitarian! An interesting and impressive fact about her is that she was appointed as
                <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/partnerships/goodwill-ambassadors/emma-watson">U.N. Goodwill Ambassador</a> in 2014.
